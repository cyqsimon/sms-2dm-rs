# sms-2dm-**rs**

A low-level parser for the `.2dm` format used by Aquaveo™️ Surface-water Modeling System (SMS).

See: [format specification](https://www.xmswiki.com/wiki/SMS:2D_Mesh_Files_*.2dm)

## Project state

This project is a stub - only a small subset of cards have implemented parsers;
the rest is ignored. More syntaxes will be supported on an as-needed basis.
Of course, PRs are always welcomed.
